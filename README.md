# Patient Recovery Prediction Challenge

This repository contains the solution for the **Patient Recovery Prediction Challenge** on Kaggle, completed as part of a **college course assignment**.  
The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient will recover within a specific timeframe based on their medical records, treatment history, and demographic features.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and categorical encoding  
   - Normalized numerical features using **StandardScaler**

2. **Modeling**
   
   Implemented and compared multiple regression models:
     - Linear Regression using LASSO
     - Random Forest Regressor  
     - Gradient Boosting Regressor  
     - XGBoost Regressor

4. **Evaluation**
   
   Used **RÂ² Score**, **MAE**, and **RMSE** for performance comparison
